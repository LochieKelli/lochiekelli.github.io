							<h2>Online Personality Tests</h2>
							<p>There are hundreds, even thousands of different tests online
								which can help you determine many different things, whether its
								a psycopath test or a creativity test. Many employers ask their potential
								employees to do these tests to judge how they would work in a team.
							</p>
							<p>I did three of these tests, the first one was the Myers-Briggs Personality
								Test from <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">16 Personalities,</a> the second was a learning
								style test from <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org">EducationPlanner,</a> and the second from
								<a href="http://www.testmycreativity.com/">TestMyCreativity.</a>
							</p>
							<h3>Personality Test (Myers-Briggs)</h3>
							<p>From the Myers-Briggs Test, I got the result ENFP, which is the
								Campaigner personality. According to the site <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">16 Personalities,</a>
								the Campaigner is a free spirit and independent character who enjoys
								the social and emotional connections they can obtain from others.
								Campaigners are curious, observant, and energetic. I feel like this
								would be useful when working in a team. I would be curious to listen
								to the other ideas which everyone has, observe how they think about
								different ideas and each other to decide what plan we should go with,
								and energetic/eager to get the project done. .</p>
							<h3>Learning Style (EducationPlanner)</h3>
							<p>According to <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org">EducationPlanner,</a>
									I am a visual learner. A visual learner needs to visualize what
									they are learning to them remember. They may not understand or
									have difficulty understanding spoken directions. Visual learners
									find it easier to read maps and picture instructions compared to
									other learning styles. </p>
							<h3>Creativity Score (TestMyCreativity)</h3>
							<p>My creativity score, according to <a href="http://www.testmycreativity.com/">TestMyCreativity,</a>
								is 39.28. Lower than the typical 63.09. According to the graph, I
								find it easier to make connections to things that don't have a
								visual reference and can theorise different concepts when it comes
								to ideas. My score is much higher in those two categories compared
								to the other six (all shown on the graph). The other six are ranked
								averagely the same, except for persistence, which is the ability to
								push through and come up with better solutions to problems or ideas,
								and perspective, which is the ability to see alternate solutions
								through different viewpoints.</p>
