							<p>The image above is mine and my fiancés engagement photo, drawn as our characters from Destiny 2, a game I am very passionate about.
								Drawn by an amazing artist named Azlaars.
							</p>
							<p>I live in Queensland with my fiancé and two of my friends from high school.
								I am a fairly average guy. I spend most of my time chilling out at
								home, playing games on my computer, and working. I currently work at 
								Shali's Café up in Montville in the Queensland Hinterland area, a
								pretty awesome place. I have a keen boss who is crazy understanding
								and is very supportive when it comes to her employees' mental and
								physical health. Previously I have participated in two subjects.</p>
							<p>One was a Dual Diploma of Hospitality Management / Business, which I
								joined because at the time, it was my dream to run a 50s styled American
								Diner in Australia. Unfortunately, I have recently figured out that
								hospitality is not my strong suit. The second was a Certificate III in Photography.
								I honestly only joined the course because my fiancé and our best friend told me I looked like a
								photographer, so I should pursue a career in that. Alas, no employment came from this course,
								and I put down my camera and haven't touched it since.</p>
